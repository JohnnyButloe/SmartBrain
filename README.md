# SmartBrain
The Python code utilizes the ImageAI library for image classification tasks. The code imports the necessary modules, sets the execution path, and initializes an ImageClassification object. The model type is set to ResNet50, and the model weights are loaded from the specified path. The image classification is performed on a sample image of a giraffe using the ResNet50 model. It prints the top 5 predicted classes along with their corresponding probabilities. 

# Example -Giraffe-
German short-haired pointer : 30.0641
impala : 19.9644
gazelle : 7.6192
zebra : 7.0338
hartebeest : 6.2695
